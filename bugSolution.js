// Solution: Check for conflicting styles, purge configuration, and ensure correct CSS import.
// Make sure your Tailwind configuration is correct and includes the necessary classes
// Check for any conflicting CSS rules that might override Tailwind's styles.
// Consider using the `!important` flag as a last resort (not recommended).
// If using a CSS framework, ensure that Tailwind is loaded after it.
